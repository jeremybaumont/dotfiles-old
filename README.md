# dotfiles

My dotfiles configuration files (.bashrc, .vimrc, .tmux.conf, ...) repository managed by Boxen. Sometimes when configuration become more complex, it is decouple to a dedicated repository (see Boxen people::jeremybaumont::repositories class for details) like for example vim with dot-vim repository or bash with dot-bashrc.d repository.
